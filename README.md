Overview
  AutoSonic is a simple autonomous car project designed to navigate its environment using an STM32 microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance. 
  The car can detect obstacles in its path and adjust its movement accordingly to avoid collisions.

Features
  Autonomous Navigation: 
  The car uses an STM32 microcontroller to process input from an ultrasonic sensor and make real-time navigation decisions.
  
  Ultrasonic Obstacle Detection:
  An ultrasonic sensor is used to detect obstacles in the car's path and measure distances, allowing the car to avoid collisions.
  
  Simple and Efficient Design: 
  The project focuses on simplicity and efficiency, making it suitable for beginners interested in learning about embedded systems and robotics.
    
  Components
    STM32 Microcontroller:
    Serves as the brain of the car, processing sensor data and controlling the motors.
    Ultrasonic Sensor: 
    Measures the distance to objects in front of the car, enabling obstacle detection.
    DC Motors and Motor Driver: 
    Provide movement and allow the car to change direction.
    Chassis and Wheels: 
    Form the physical structure of the car.
